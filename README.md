# About-Me

I have completed my masters degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering in the year 2021. I have been worked as a student associate in my college where I have used advanced software tools to collect and interpret datas of students, from there I started to learn using the different database and software tools. I have a passion for new technology, so I enjoy using industry-standard tools to create scalable and flexible solutions in an Agile environment.

I have a strong foundation of research skills and analytical problem solving abilities, so I am able to learn any coding language quickly. My passion is learning about new coding design elements, cutting-edge coding languages, and creating logical frameworks for projects from start to finish. As I work with Revature, I feel excited to start my day and learn more techniques to further improve my skills. 



I like doing arts and crafts work that's how I relax.
