# About-Me

I have completed my masters degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering in the year 2021. I have worked as a student associate in my college where I have used advanced software tools to collect and interpret data of students, from there I started to learn using the different database and software tools. Apart from that I have worked as a project coordinator in electronics and communication engineering industry, there I have gained valuable skills in written and verbal communication across multiple channels through collaborating with engineers in different departments, interacting with clients regarding project needs, and coordinating with field technicians remotely. I have a passion for new technology, so I enjoy using industry-standard tools to create scalable and flexible solutions in an Agile environment.

I have a strong foundation of research skills and analytical problem-solving abilities, so I am able to learn any coding language quickly. My passion is learning about new coding design elements, cutting-edge coding languages, and creating logical frameworks for projects from start to finish. As I work with Revature, I feel excited to start my day and learn more techniques to further improve my skills.
