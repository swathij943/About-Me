# About-Me

I have completed my masters degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering in the year 2021. I have a passion for new technology, so I enjoy using industry-standard tools to create scalable and flexible solutions in an Agile environment. 

I have a strong foundation of research skills and analytical problem solving abilities, so I am able to learn any coding language quickly. My passion is learning about new coding design elements, cutting-edge coding languages, and creating logical frameworks for projects from start to finish.
